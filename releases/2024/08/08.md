## Before we promote:

## After we're done:

- Run `./manage.py process_files --task=backfill_file_manifest` in an addons-server pod. It should take a few seconds to trigger a bunch of celery tasks in the background.
- We need to clear a backlog of old replies that weren't enqueues for review, but are now, starting with https://github.com/mozilla/addons-server/commit/9fac55cd40ba9488341fcbeb2b21f7b3dde10f02. Please run the following `UPDATE` statement against production database:
```
UPDATE reviewers_needshumanreview nhr
JOIN versions v ON v.id = nhr.version_id
SET nhr.is_active = 0
WHERE nhr.is_active = 1
  AND v.due_date IS NULL
  AND nhr.reason = 6;
```
